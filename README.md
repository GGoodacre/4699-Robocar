## About

The Robot Car Project is a school project with a focus on building a robot car capable of navigating through an arena, shooting four targets, and reaching the finish line as quickly as possible. The project demands proficiency in both automatic and manual operation of the robot car.

### Objectives

- **Navigation:** Develop a robot car that can efficiently navigate a static are, both in automatic and manual modes.
  
- **Target Shooting:** Implement a shooting mechanism to accurately target and hit four designated points within the arena, showcasing precision and control in both automatic and manual operation.

- **Speed Challenge:** Optimize the robot's performance to complete the course and reach the finish line as quickly as possible, demonstrating agility and speed in both automatic and manual modes.

The project provides a hands-on experience for students, requiring them to explore robotics, sensors, and actuators, while also presenting a dual-operation challenge in both automatic and manual scenarios.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Control the robot car remotely using a Wi-Fi.
- **Autonomous Mode:** Enable autonomous mode for the robot car to navigate and avoid obstacles.
- **Targeting:** All targeting is done automatically even if you control the robot remotely allowing you to focus on the navigating the arena
